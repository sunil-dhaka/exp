TO THE MEMORY OF
SARAH ORNE JEWETT
IN WHOSE BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATE WORK
THERE IS THE PERFECTION
THAT ENDURES




PRAIRIE SPRING


Evening and the flat land,
Rich and sombre and always silent;
The miles of fresh-plowed soil,
Heavy and black, full of strength and harshness;
The growing wheat, the growing weeds,
The toiling horses, the tired men;
The long empty roads,
Sullen fires of sunset, fading,
The eternal, unresponsive sky.
Against all this, Youth,
Flaming like the wild roses,
Singing like the larks over the plowed fields,
Flashing like a star out of the twilight;
Youth with its insupportable sweetness,
Its fierce necessity,
Its sharp desire,
Singing and singing,
Out of the lips of silence,
Out of the earthy dusk.




PART I.
The Wild Land




I


One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored
on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist
of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low
drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The
dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some
of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if
they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open
plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling
wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply
rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway
station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the
lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this
road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general
merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the
saloon, the post-office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled
snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come
back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The
children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets
but a few rough-looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long
caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives
to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one
store into the shelter of another. At the hitch-bars along the street a
few heavy work-horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their
blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not
be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy,
crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was
much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His
shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long
stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his
clumsy, copper-toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his
nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried
quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was
afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help,
so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole
beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At
the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly
and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been
left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in
her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little
creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to
move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and
this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where
people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and
awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear some one might
laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last
he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up
and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and
resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was
going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster (not as if it were an
affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her;
carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with
a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep
blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see
anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy
until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped
down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What
is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her
up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat,
pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if
you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have
known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her
arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and
faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t
come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’
wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do
something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s
your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still,
till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.
A shabby little traveling man, who was just then coming out of the
store on his way to the saloon, stopped and gazed stupidly at the
shining mass of hair she bared when she took off her veil; two thick
braids, pinned about her head in the German way, with a fringe of
reddish-yellow curls blowing out from under her cap. He took his cigar
out of his mouth and held the wet end between the fingers of his woolen
glove. “My God, girl, what a head of hair!” he exclaimed, quite
innocently and foolishly. She stabbed him with a glance of Amazonian
fierceness and drew in her lower lip—most unnecessary severity. It gave
the little clothing drummer such a start that he actually let his cigar
fall to the sidewalk and went off weakly in the teeth of the wind to
the saloon. His hand was still unsteady when he took his glass from the
bartender. His feeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before,
but never so mercilessly. He felt cheap and ill-used, as if some one
had taken advantage of him. When a drummer had been knocking about in
little drab towns and crawling across the wintry country in dirty
smoking-cars, was he to be blamed if, when he chanced upon a fine human
creature, he suddenly wished himself more of a man?

While the little drummer was drinking to recover his nerve, Alexandra
hurried to the drug store as the most likely place to find Carl
Linstrum. There he was, turning over a portfolio of chromo “studies”
which the druggist sold to the Hanover women who did china-painting.
Alexandra explained her predicament, and the boy followed her to the
corner, where Emil still sat by the pole.

“I’ll have to go up after her, Alexandra. I think at the depot they
have some spikes I can strap on my feet. Wait a minute.” Carl thrust
his hands into his pockets, lowered his head, and darted up the street
against the north wind. He was a tall boy of fifteen, slight and
narrow-chested. When he came back with the spikes, Alexandra asked him
what he had done with his overcoat.

“I left it in the drug store. I couldn’t climb in it, anyhow. Catch me
if I fall, Emil,” he called back as he began his ascent. Alexandra
watched him anxiously; the cold was bitter enough on the ground. The
kitten would not budge an inch. Carl had to go to the very top of the
pole, and then had some difficulty in tearing her from her hold. When
he reached the ground, he handed the cat to her tearful little master.
“Now go into the store with her, Emil, and get warm.” He opened the
door for the child. “Wait a minute, Alexandra. Why can’t I drive for
you as far as our place? It’s getting colder every minute. Have you
seen the doctor?”

“Yes. He is coming over to-morrow. But he says father can’t get better;
can’t get well.” The girl’s lip trembled. She looked fixedly up the
bleak street as if she were gathering her strength to face something,
as if she were trying with all her might to grasp a situation which, no
matter how painful, must be met and dealt with somehow. The wind
flapped the skirts of her heavy coat about her.

Carl did not say anything, but she felt his sympathy. He, too, was
lonely. He was a thin, frail boy, wi...
