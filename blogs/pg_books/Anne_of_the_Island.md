Anne of the Island




Chapter I
The Shadow of Change


“Harvest is ended and summer is gone,” quoted Anne Shirley, gazing
across the shorn fields dreamily. She and Diana Barry had been picking
apples in the Green Gables orchard, but were now resting from their
labors in a sunny corner, where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by
on the wings of a wind that was still summer-sweet with the incense of
ferns in the Haunted Wood.

But everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn. The sea
was roaring hollowly in the distance, the fields were bare and sere,
scarfed with golden rod, the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed
with asters of ethereal purple, and the Lake of Shining Waters was
blue—blue—blue; not the changeful blue of spring, nor the pale azure of
summer, but a clear, steadfast, serene blue, as if the water were past
all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility
unbroken by fickle dreams.

“It has been a nice summer,” said Diana, twisting the new ring on her
left hand with a smile. “And Miss Lavendar’s wedding seemed to come as
a sort of crown to it. I suppose Mr. and Mrs. Irving are on the Pacific
coast now.”

“It seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the
world,” sighed Anne.

“I can’t believe it is only a week since they were married. Everything
has changed. Miss Lavendar and Mr. and Mrs. Allan gone—how lonely the
manse looks with the shutters all closed! I went past it last night,
and it made me feel as if everybody in it had died.”

“We’ll never get another minister as nice as Mr. Allan,” said Diana,
with gloomy conviction. “I suppose we’ll have all kinds of supplies
this winter, and half the Sundays no preaching at all. And you and
Gilbert gone—it will be awfully dull.”

“Fred will be here,” insinuated Anne slyly.

“When is Mrs. Lynde going to move up?” asked Diana, as if she had not
heard Anne’s remark.

“Tomorrow. I’m glad she’s coming—but it will be another change. Marilla
and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday. Do you know,
I hated to do it? Of course, it was silly—but it did seem as if we were
committing sacrilege. That old spare room has always seemed like a
shrine to me. When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful
apartment in the world. You remember what a consuming desire I had to
sleep in a spare room bed—but not the Green Gables spare room. Oh, no,
never there! It would have been too terrible—I couldn’t have slept a
wink from awe. I never _walked_ through that room when Marilla sent me
in on an errand—no, indeed, I tiptoed through it and held my breath, as
if I were in church, and felt relieved when I got out of it. The
pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there,
one on each side of the mirror, and frowned so sternly at me all the
time I was in, especially if I dared peep in the mirror, which was the
only one in the house that didn’t twist my face a little. I always
wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room. And now it’s not only
cleaned but stripped bare. George Whitefield and the Duke have been
relegated to the upstairs hall. ‘So passes the glory of this world,’”
concluded Anne, with a laugh in which there was a little note of
regret. It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated, even
when we have outgrown them.

“I’ll be so lonesome when you go,” moaned Diana for the hundredth time.
“And to think you go next week!”

“But we’re together still,” said Anne cheerily. “We mustn’t let next
week rob us of this week’s joy. I hate the thought of going myself—home
and I are such good friends. Talk of being lonesome! It’s I who should
groan. _You’ll_ be here with any number of your old friends—_and_ Fred!
While I shall be alone among strangers, not knowing a soul!”

“_Except_ Gilbert—_and_ Charlie Sloane,” said Diana, imitating Anne’s
italics and slyness.

“Charlie Sloane will be a great comfort, of course,” agreed Anne
sarcastically; whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed.
Diana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane; but, despite
sundry confidential talks, she did not know just what Anne thought of
Gilbert Blythe. To be sure, Anne herself did not know that.

“The boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport, for all I
know,” Anne went on. “I am glad I’m going to Redmond, and I am sure I
shall like it after a while. But for the first few weeks I know I
won’t. I shan’t even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend
visit home, as I had when I went to Queen’s. Christmas will seem like a
thousand years away.”

“Everything is changing—or going to change,” said Diana sadly. “I have
a feeling that things will never be the same again, Anne.”

“We have come to a parting of the ways, I suppose,” said Anne
thoughtfully. “We had to come to it. Do you think, Diana, that being
grown-up is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we
were children?”

“I don’t know—there are _some_ nice things about it,” answered Diana,
again caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the
effect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced. “But
there are so many puzzling things, too. Sometimes I feel as if being
grown-up just frightened me—and then I would give anything to be a
little girl again.”

“I suppose we’ll get used to being grownup in time,” said Anne
cheerfully. “There won’t be so many unexpected things about it by and
by—though, after all, I fancy it’s the unexpected things that give
spice to life. We’re eighteen, Diana. In two more years we’ll be
twenty. When I was ten I thought twenty was a green old age. In no time
you’ll be a staid, middle-aged matron, and I shall be nice, old maid
Aunt Anne, coming to visit you on vacations. You’ll always keep a
corner for me, won’t you, Di darling? Not the spare room, of course—old
maids can’t aspire to spare rooms, and I shall be as ’umble as _Uriah
Heep_, and quite content with a little over-the-porch or off-the-parlor
cubby hole.”

“What nonsense you do talk, Anne,” laughed Diana. “You’ll marry
somebody splendid and handsome and rich—and no spare room in Avonlea
will be half gorgeous enough for you—and you’ll turn up your nose at
all the friends of your youth.”

“That would be a pity; my nose is quite nice, but I fear turning it up
would spoil it,” said Anne, patting that shapely organ. “I haven’t so
many good features that I could afford to spoil those I have; so, even
if I should marry the King of the Cannibal Islands, I promise you I
won’t turn up my nose at you, Diana.”

With another gay laugh the girls separated, Diana to return to Orchard
Slope, Anne to walk to the Post Office. She found a letter awaiting her
there, and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her on the bridge over the Lake
of Shining Waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it.

“Priscilla Grant is going to Redmond, too,” she exclaimed. “Isn’t that
splendid? I hoped she would, but she didn’t think her father would
consent. He has, however, and we’re to board together. I feel that I
can face an army with banners—or all the professors of Redmond in one
fell phalanx—with a chum like Priscilla by my side.”

“I think we’ll like Kingsport,” said Gilbert. “It’s a nice old burg,
they tell me, and has the finest natural park in the world. I’ve heard
that the scenery in it is magnificent.”

“I wonder if it will be—can be—any more beautiful than this,” murmured
Anne, looking around her with the loving, enraptured eyes of those to
whom “home” must always be the loveliest spot in the world, no matter
what fairer lands may lie under alien stars.

They were leaning on the bridge of the old pond, drinking deep of the
enchantment of the dusk, just at the spot where Anne had climbed from
her sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot. The fine,
empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies, but the moon
was rising and the water lay like a great, silver dream in her light.
Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures.

“You are very quiet, Anne,” said Gilbert at last.

“I’m afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will
vanish just like a broken silence,” breat...
