PREFACE
=======
This is the ASCII online distribution of the Online World. It deals
with the practical aspects of using the rapidly growing global online
information resource.
    The book is distributed in a form that is designed to be easily
accessible with the maximum range of computers, printer types, and
search programs. Also, it has been designed to be compatible with
electronic reading devices for the blind. Therefore, many frills
(such as fancy formatting, extraneous characters or tags) have been
omitted.
    The main subject of the book is what you can get out of the
online resource.
    Expect an outline, not a comprehensive list or directory of all
available offerings. This book explores selected applications
across network and service boundaries, to show how these needs may
be satisfied.
    In the process, it gives access information for a large number
of specific online offerings.
    The applications range from entertainment and the bizarre to
databases and special services for professionals and organizations.
    You are not expected to live in the United States or in Norway.
Emphasis is on major international offerings available through
services and networks like the Internet, BITNET, CompuServe, Echo,
FidoNet, Usenet, Dialcom, Dow Jones/News Retrieval, MCI, NewsNet
and UUCP. These services can be accessed from almost anywhere.
    Talking about the Internet, we do not expect that it will be
easy for you to get full access. We assume that most people can get
access to this network by electronic mail only.
    I wrote The Online World for parents and youth, teachers,
students, business people, social workers, psychologists, young,
old, for anybody interested in knowing a bit more about our
current "Global Village."
    You can read it like a novel, to get an idea of what is going
on. It can be used as a practical guide book to online data bases
and news sources, or as a book of reference.
    You need not be a computer expert or an experienced "onliner"
to find it useful.
    While not being a textbook on data communications, it contains
much information to help novices get started. For an introduction
to telecommunications, check out appendix 2 and 3 before continuing
with Chapter 1.
    Before you start, one word of warning. New online offerings are
born each day, while others are being closed down. Chances are that
most services in this book will still be around when you read it,
but I will need to update the text regularly. Therefore, all
feedback is welcomed with thanks.
    Please do also tell me what you like, what you don't, and what
you feel I may have missed -- or have gotten hopelessly wrong. Send
by electronic mail to me at opresno@extern.uio.no .

This book is not free
---------------------
The Online World book is NOT public domain. It is copyrighted work
and may be distributed only pursuant to this license.
    You are granted a limited read and use license of the book to
see if it is for you. Any unregistered use other than to determine
if the book meets your needs is a violation of this license and is
forbidden.
    If you like the book, please become a registered reader. Your
contribution will support further research and development of the
text.
    The important benefit of registering is that you will receive
the latest version of the book on diskette (MS-DOS only). This will
allow you to have current information on your hard disk  that you
can search whenever you want to.
     The online world is dynamic. Services and offerings come and
go. So read appendix 8 to find out how to stay updated.

The registered shareware version of The Online World including
shipping and handling is

              NOK 105.00           for payment by credit card
                                   (around US$ 15.00)
              US$ 20.00            for all other types of payment
                                   (check or SWIFT bank transfer)

As an alternative, you can also register for six updates of the
book during one year. The updates will be mailed you on computer
diskette:

              US$60.00             for all types of payment

The special rates for organizations to make the text available to
employees etc. over a network are explained in appendix 8.
    Please note: As I do not receive any renumeration from vendors
of shareware disks, you must register your copy to have a legal
license for use of the book beyond an evaluation period.

Please give to others
---------------------
Permission is with this granted to reproduce and distribute the
Online World book so long as:

    (1)  No remuneration of any kind is received in exchange.
         A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of a
         diskette, shipping and handling, as long as the total
         (per disk) does not exceed US$8.00.
    (2)  Distribution is without  ANY modification to the contents
         of all accompanying text files, including the copyright
         notice and this license. All of the files in this package
         are to be distributed together.
    (3)  No publication of the book or individual articles from the
         book in print is permitted, in any language, without the
         express written consent of the author.

If archiving this book for BBS use or library use, please include
all files and use the name ONLINE10, for example, ONLINE10.ZIP,  or
ONLINE10.LZH. This will provide consistency for future updates.

No copy of this book may be distributed  without including a copy
of this license.  Any other use, including bundling of any of the
book's chapters or appendixes for your own distribution, is
prohibited without express, written permission in advance from the
author.

The Online World book is regularly being updated. Information about
where to get the latest version of the book can be retrieved from
TOW, a mailing list set up to support the project. For information,
send electronic mail to LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu (LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 on
BITNET) containing the command "GET TOW MASTER".

How to read the book
--------------------
You may read the book using any ASCII viewing or text searching
program. My private favorites are:

    LIST       -  Shareware MS-DOS file viewing program,

    LOOKFOR    -  Shareware boolean text search program.
