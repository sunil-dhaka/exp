THE BOOK OF MORMON

An Account Written
 BY THE HAND OF MORMON

UPON PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI


Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi,
and also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant
of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of
commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of
revelation—Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they
might not be destroyed—To come forth by the gift and power of God unto
the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up
unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile—The
interpretation thereof by the gift of God.

An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of
the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded
the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to
heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what
great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may
know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And
also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST,
the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there
are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the
things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of
Christ.


 TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, JUN.
 THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom
this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and
our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record,
which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites,
their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the
tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been
translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it
unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we
also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the
plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not
of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God
came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we
beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that
it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that
we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is
marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us
that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the
commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know
that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the
blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of
Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the
honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is
one God. Amen.

 THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES

Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom
this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this
work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which
have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said
Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the
engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work,
and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of
soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and
hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of
which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness
unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing
witness of it.

THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY (1 Nephi)


An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being called,
(beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns
Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth
unto the people concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his
life. He taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with his
family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth to the land of
Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account of their
sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their
families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and
afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their travels. They come
to the large waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth
them, and buildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful.
They cross the large waters into the promised land, and so forth. This
is according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I, Nephi,
wrote this record.

1 Nephi Chapter 1

1:1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was
taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many
afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly
favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge
of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of
my proceedings in my days.

1:2 Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists
of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.

1:3 And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with
mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.

1:4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the
reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at
Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many
prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the
great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.

1:5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth
prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his
people.

1:6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar
of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much;
and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and
tremble exceedingly.

1:7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem;
and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and
the things which he had seen.

1:8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a
vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God
sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of
angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.

1:9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of
heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at
noon-day.

1:10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness
did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.

1:11 And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and
the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book,
and bade him that he should read.

1:12 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit
of the Lord.

1:13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine
abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning
Jerusalem—that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof;
many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away
captive into Babylon.

1:14 And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many
great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord;
such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy
throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy
are over all the inhabitants of the earth, and, because thou art
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall
perish!

1:15 And after this manner was the language of my father in the
praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was
filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord
had shown unto him.

1:16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which
my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in
visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he
prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a
full account.

1:17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold,
