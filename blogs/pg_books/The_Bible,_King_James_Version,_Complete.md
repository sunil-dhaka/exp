The King James Bible


Notes from the previous editions:

This is a modified version of: The Project Gutenberg Edition of the
King James Bible.

The only changes made were the addition of the book numbers to the
verse numbers to make it easier to find desired passages of text in
this work and the addition of a Table Of Contents.

**** This version of the King James Bible was created by taking several
public domain copies and painstakingly comparing them to find all the
differences, and selecting the most common version. Each of the
differences was also compared to printed versions for verification.

Book 01 Genesis


01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters.

01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
light from the darkness.

01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were under the firmament from the waters which were above the
firmament: and it was so.

01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.

01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering
together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself,
after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and
for seasons, and for days, and years:

01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
give light upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth,

01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the
moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
in the open firmament of heaven.

01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

01:001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

01:001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth
after his kind: and it was so.

01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and
cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

01:001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
created he him; male and female created he them.

01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth.

01:001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the
which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for
meat.

01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the
air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it
was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
host of them.

01:002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

01:002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth
when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and
the heavens,

01:002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused
it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the
whole face of the ground.

01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and
there he put the man whom he had formed.

01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also
in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

01:002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
onyx stone.

01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it
that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

01:002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it
which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
Euphrates.

01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden
of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

01:002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
the garden thou mayest freely eat:

01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die.

01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

01:002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the
air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found
an help meet for him.

01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and
he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof;

01:002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he
a woman, and brought her unto the man.

01:002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.

01:003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God
said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
of the trees of the garden:

01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the mi...
