PREFACE


It is difficult to say what are and what are not the Fables of Æsop.
Almost all the fables that have appeared in the Western world have been
sheltered at one time or another under the shadow of that name. I could
at any rate enumerate at least seven hundred which have appeared in
English in various books entitled _Æsop’s Fables_. L’Estrange’s
collection alone contains over five hundred. In the struggle for
existence among all these a certain number stand out as being the most
effective and the most familiar. I have attempted to bring most of
these into the following pages.

There is no fixed text even for the nucleus collection contained in
this book. Æsop himself is so shadowy a figure that we might almost be
forgiven if we held, with regard to him, the heresy of Mistress
Elizabeth Prig. What we call his fables can in most cases be traced
back to the fables of other people, notably of Phædrus and Babrius. It
is usual to regard the Greek Prose Collections, passing under the name
of Æsop, as having greater claims to the eponymous title; but modern
research has shown that these are but medieval prosings of Babrius’s
verse. I have therefore felt at liberty to retell the fables in such a
way as would interest children, and have adopted from the various
versions that which seemed most suitable in each case, telling the
fable anew in my own way.

Much has been learnt during the present century about the history of
the various apologues that walk abroad under the name of “Æsop.” I have
attempted to bring these various lines of research together in the
somewhat elaborate introductory volume which I wrote to accompany my
edition of Caxton’s _Æsop_, published by Mr. Nutt in his _Bibliothèque
de Carabas_. I have placed in front of the present version of the
“Fables,” by kind permission of Mr. Nutt, the short abstract of my
researches in which I there summed up the results of that volume. I
must accompany it, here as there, by a warning to the reader, that for
a large proportion of the results thus reached I am myself responsible;
but I am happy to say that many of them have been accepted by the
experts in America, France, and Germany, who have done me the honour to
consider my researches. Here, in England, there does not seem to be
much interest in this class of work, and English scholars, for the most
part, are content to remain in ignorance of the methods and results of
literary history.

I have attached to the “Fables” in the obscurity of small print at the
end a series of notes, summing up what is known as to the _provenance_
of each fable. Here, again, I have tried to put in shorter and more
readable form the results of my researches in the volume to which I
have already referred. For more detailed information I must refer to
the forty closely-printed pages (vol. i. pp. 225-268) which contain the
bibliography of the Fables.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ÆSOPIC FABLE


Most nations develop the Beast-Tale as part of their folk-lore, some go
further and apply it to satiric purposes, and a few nations afford
isolated examples of the shaping of the Beast-Tale to teach some moral
truth by means of the Fable properly so called.[1] But only two peoples
independently made this a general practice. Both in Greece[2] and in
India we find in the earliest literature such casual and frequent
mention of Fables as seems to imply a body of Folk-Fables current among
the people. And in both countries special circumstances raised the
Fable from folklore into literature. In Greece, during the epoch of the
Tyrants, when free speech was dangerous, the Fable was largely used for
political purposes. The inventor of this application or the most
prominent user of it was one Æsop, a slave at Samos whose name has ever
since been connected with the Fable. All that we know about him is
contained in a few lines of Herodotus: that he flourished 550 B.C.; was
killed in accordance with a Delphian oracle; and that _wergild_ was
claimed for him by the grandson of his master, Iadmon. When free speech
was established in the Greek democracies, the custom of using Fables in
harangues was continued and encouraged by the rhetoricians, while the
mirth-producing qualities of the Fable caused it to be regarded as fit
subject of after-dinner conversation along with other jests of a
broader kind (“Milesian,” “Sybaritic”). This habit of regarding the
Fable as a form of the Jest intensified the tendency to connect it with
a well-known name as in the case of our Joe Miller. About 300 B.C.
Demetrius Phalereus, whilom tyrant of Athens and founder of the
Alexandria Library, collected together all the Fables he could find
under the title of _Assemblies of Æsopic Tales_ (Λόγων Αἰσωπείων
συναγωγαι). This collection, running probably to some 200 Fables, after
being interpolated and edited by the Alexandrine grammarians, was
turned into neat Latin iambics by Phædrus, a Greek freedman of Augustus
in the early years of the Christian era. As the modern Æsop is mainly
derived from Phædrus, the answer to the question “Who wrote Æsop?” is
simple : “Demetrius of Phaleron.”[3]

 [1] _E.g._ Jotham’s Fable, Judges ix., and that of Menenius Agrippa in
 Livy, seem to be quite independent of either Greek or Indian
 influence. But one fable does not make Fable.


 [2] Only about twenty fables, however, are known in Greece before
 Phædrus, 30 A.D. See my Caxton’s _Æsop_ vol. i. pp. 26–29, for a
 complete enumeration.


 [3] For this statement and what follows a reference to the Pedigree of
 the Fables on p. 196 will be found useful.


In India the great ethical reformer, Sakyamuni, the Buddha, initiated
(or adopted from the Brahmins) the habit of using the Beast-Tale for
moral purposes, or, in other words, transformed it into the Fable
proper. A collection of these seems to have existed previously and
independently, in which the Fables were associated with the name of a
mythical sage, Kasyâpa. These were appropriated by the early Buddhists
by the simple expedient of making Kasyâpa the immediately preceding
incarnation of the Buddha. A number of his _itihâsas_ or Tales were
included in the sacred Buddhistic work containing the _Jātakas_ or
previous-births of the Buddha, in some of which the Bodisat (or future
Buddha) appears as one of the Dramatis Personæ of the Fables; the
Crane, _e.g._, in our _Wolf and Crane_ being one of the incarnations of
the Buddha. So, too, the Lamb of our _Wolf and Lamb_ was once Buddha;
it was therefore easy for him—so the Buddhists thought—to remember and
tell these Fables as incidents of his former careers. It is obvious
that the whole idea of a Fable as an anecdote about a man masquerading
in the form of a beast could most easily arise and gain currency where
the theory of transmigration was vividly credited.
