The fields of balsam root and Lupine are in full bloom and the wind smells of lilac. I was working the entire day at my shop, doing all sorts of tedious work activities, until the sunset. I used the last bit of energy reserves I had to go and see the wild Meadows in their full glory. All I did was wander about for a bit and pick some flowers, but when I finally left due to a rainstorm, I felt that today had great value and I was so happy to have made the effort to go witness the springtime at its most abundant.

This decision got me thinking about how hard it can be after a long work day to find time to do what you love or find the motivation for that matter. It's so much easier to perpetually put off goals and passions for another day that never comes. Maybe we spend a lot of time watching TV or on our phones, and while there's nothing wrong with this, it can be troublesome when we actually want to do something different with our time and just feel too burned out to do so.

I thought I would share a few things that have helped me, but firstly, I must say that it is a perfectly good thing to rest and do nothing productive with your time off. We don't need to produce anything to show that we used our time well, and we all need to allow ourselves quality rest that helps us feel better the next day. We might sometimes feel shame for taking time just to have fun or take a nap, or simply waste time by other standards, and I think it's so important to know we have innate value. We don't need to prove it, we can just be.

However, if you're truly wanting to change your lifestyle a bit and aren't sure where to begin, maybe these ideas will help. But I don't know, everyone is different. Thank you. I know this is an obvious one, but distractions that give us instant gratification over long-term rewards can have a strong pull on our time off. Limiting these things may be uncomfortable at first, you may find yourself not wanting to be without them, but over time, you'll get used to it and may find a renewal of interest and energy to put into other things that bring you joy.

At least for me, I found I had more energy when I simply didn't have the option of scrolling for hours or watching TV more than I wished. And again, there's nothing wrong with this, but it may help to limit it if you really want to put time into other projects. After I forced myself to find alternative forms of entertainment, I slowly developed the energy and interest to do them consistently.

I have been wanting to work on this porch for quite a long time, and I just haven't felt quite up to it. So I'm glad I got it done today. I've been wanting to paint the furniture and put out some new plants that will thrive in the shade, such as bleeding hearts and forget-me-nots. I'm really happy with how it's all turned out, and now that I'm on a bit of a roll with getting projects done, I'm gonna go make some dried flower art. I've had some flowers pressed between some books for quite a few weeks, so I'm going to take them out and create some art pieces with them and share that with you because it's a bit of my tradition, not only on this channel but a springtime tradition for myself, that I always create art with the spring flowers. So I will bring you along with me, and I'm going to begin by gathering some lilacs.

Also, I find it helpful to develop a great reverence and value for working on projects and hobbies that benefit your mental health. Perhaps you may not always want to take a long walk or work on a mindful hobby, but if you know you need to do it in order to manage stress, improve your memory, or feel better, it may help you form the habit. I'm yet to meet someone who wants to do something that's good for them every day, but if their beliefs align with their pastimes, they see that it is necessary to thrive, even if it's hard sometimes.

And of course, be patient with your process. It will take time to find what works for you and what helps motivate you to make time for your hobbies and interests. Sometimes it's just about starting with one small step. For me, I found journaling a little every day was a great first step to feeling like I accomplished something small for myself. That one achievement motivated me to make other changes.

Hello. This is a project I've been working on all day today, and I have been enjoying it so much, so I wanted to tell you. If it is Springtime where you are living right now and you have access to a nursery or you have some house plants or a bouquet that you can use some of the flowers for dried flower art, that is a wonderful craft and it looks so beautiful. It's really hard to mess it up, to be honest.

If you're wondering why I am so close to the camera and I'm kind of backed up in a corner, it's because I haven't actually filmed up here in the tree house room for a very long time. I used to do a lot of clips up here, but it's been a while because my husband Luke has been working on renovating this area. He has a background in construction and he's very good with woodworking, and he wants to make this room into a bedroom, we hope. So here is why you haven't been up here for a while. There is a lot of things moving and changing, and Luke has been working on trying to put in some sort of closet because currently we don't really have one, and there is a very small room back there that doesn't even fit a bed. So we're hoping to move out of that room at some point and be here. That is the goal. I'll give you an update once it's done. There is your little home update. It is all chaos, and my cat loves it. There's even a shelf in my way, and so I am looking forward to using this room once again. But in the meantime, I have been focusing energy on decorating downstairs because that is what I'm able to do.

Apart from that, it has been a fairly busy week, and I don't know what next week is going to look like. My little puppy has a lump on his head that has been there for a little while, and the veterinarian said it was finally time to probably remove it. So I might be having surgery next week. That has been something that's been a bit on my mind, so we'll see how the next week goes. Hopefully, everything's okay, but he is doing really well right now, and he's getting a lot of treats and a lot of extra pets, and he's very, very happy.

I also have been spending quite a bit of time reading. I think I've read about 50 books this year so far. It has been quite shocking to me to have read so many books. I think it's because I really made an effort to pick up my book over my phone this year, and that has made a huge difference. I've been so excited about all the new stories I've been reading. I recently started "Painted Devils" by Margaret Owen. The cover looks a little bit spooky, so I'm not sure if it's going to be my cup of tea. However, I really loved her first book in the series called "Little Thieves," and it was all inspired by Germanic folklore, and I really enjoyed it. So I'm gonna see how this one goes, and I will keep you updated on all my new reading adventures.

I hope you enjoyed this topic of this video this week, and let me know if there's any other topics you are interested in hearing about. I know I've talked about this one before, but I did want to revisit it just because it is something that has impacted me greatly this year. You know, really trying to put in new habits and hobbies into my day that I tended to not have time and energy for last year. Last year, I was working three different jobs, and I just felt exhausted all the time. And I got ill as well, and so it was just a very difficult combination that I didn't share too much about on this channel, but I did make a few videos talking about how I was just having a hard time feeling energized and feeling okay. And thankfully, I'm starting to feel a lot better.

I will always be someone who is not always feeling very motivated or energized. It is just natural to who I am. But I know that that's something that a lot of people deal with, so that's why I wanted to talk in this video about at least a few little things that helped me find the motivation and the ability to do at least some things I love every day. Because it is so much easier to just get back from a long work day and just vegetate, and that, if you have every right to do that. I think that we sometimes shame ourselves for taking the rest we need, and if you need rest, you need to rest. And that is something that I did a lot of last year, and there were times that I felt sorry for myself because I wasn't getting projects done that I really wanted to. But I wish if I could go back to encourage myself and comfort myself, perhaps things aren't going exactly how you may have wished, but you can do the best you can by taking care of yourself. And so that was what I wanted to reiterate in regards to this video.

I definitely found spending a little bit more time meditating on my life of today versus tomorrow, what do I want to do with these days, this incredible gift that has been given to me, developing that philosophy of not what you were doing, but why you were doing it in regards to your lifestyle, I think is what will help make a permanent change. For me, I used to force myself to try to eat healthier food because I thought that it was just good for me and it's what I should do and I should just force it. But it wasn't until I got quite ill and then I wasn't feeling well, realized I wanted to put great value in living a long and healthy life, at least as healthy as I'm capable of living. And that philosophy, developing that reason why I was making those lifestyle changes, is what actually made it happen, not just forcing myself to do it without any other reason but just that I should do it or someone told me I should do it.

Defining what you want to be doing with your life, not what someone else told you you should be doing or what society makes you feel like you should be doing, but what you really, really want to do, I think can be so helpful. For me, it was about following my spirit and seeing where that takes me and what lifestyle changes I feel I not only want to do but need to do for my mental health, for my stress management, for feeling better altogether, feeling like the days are full of more fulfillment. That made all the difference. The why is so much more important, I think, than the what you are doing.

I hope you have a wonderful week, and you maybe try a new craft or hobby this week, or just try to do something a little bit different that you usually don't do. Maybe just spend a little time writing down how you feel in a journal or going on a walk or learning something new. And let me know if there's any other topics you'd like me to cover in a video. And I will see you very soon. Sending so much love. Goodbye.
