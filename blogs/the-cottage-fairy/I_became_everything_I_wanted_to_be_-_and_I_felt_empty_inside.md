## [I became everything I wanted to be - and I felt empty inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigHJ3lk-QA)

Foreign Music. Wildflower season is upon us and the hillsides are swathed in white and gold and blue. I had a day off from work, so I took an audiobook out to the meadow next to my home and listened to fairy tales while putting flowers in my hair and imagining far-off kingdoms and castles. I got quite caught up in my daydreams and found that in no time at all it was noon and time to get ready for a dinner with my family that evening. I don't get to enjoy a lazy day too often, but it makes it that much more special when it comes around.

I just had to take a moment to stop and appreciate the wildflowers right now. It is so abundant, and I feel like this is the gift that we get for waiting out the winter. You know, the winter was so long this year, and to get such incredible beauty and abundance in return for that long cold weight is so beautiful, and I just couldn't be happier right now.


Thank you.

I concluded I'd simply gotten it wrong. I needed a new dream to work towards a goal. So my goal became being an editor for a magazine and a bookseller. These dreams seemed a lot more reasonable, and soon I was working for three different magazines, running a school publication, and later worked at a bookstore full-time. Even though I had once again achieved my dreams, I was still struggling to feel at peace.

Perhaps what I was missing was a good relationship with more friends, the perfect place to live. Maybe I needed a new dream altogether. Perhaps if I just had everything lined up in life just so, things would be different. There was something much deeper that was off, something that was following me everywhere. It took a long time to admit to myself that I was searching for peace and achievements when instead I needed to love and accept myself as a soul and nothing else. My achievements could only be a temporary Band-Aid over my wounds, and that was just it. I was carrying my hurts and pains and worries everywhere I went, and I had to heal those things first if I was ever going to find a renewed zest for life.
