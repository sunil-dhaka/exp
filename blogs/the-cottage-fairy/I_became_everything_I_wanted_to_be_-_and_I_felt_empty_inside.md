## [I became everything I wanted to be - and I felt empty inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigHJ3lk-QA)

Foreign Music. Wildflower season is upon us and the hillsides are swathed in white and gold and blue. I had a day off from work, so I took an audiobook out to the meadow next to my home and listened to fairy tales while putting flowers in my hair and imagining far-off kingdoms and castles. I got quite caught up in my daydreams and found that in no time at all it was noon and time to get ready for a dinner with my family that evening. I don't get to enjoy a lazy day too often, but it makes it that much more special when it comes around.

I just had to take a moment to stop and appreciate the wildflowers right now. It is so abundant, and I feel like this is the gift that we get for waiting out the winter. You know, the winter was so long this year, and to get such incredible beauty and abundance in return for that long cold weight is so beautiful, and I just couldn't be happier right now.

In this video, I wanted to share a dream I had as a young college student. I wanted to be a successful scholar and spend days writing endless essays in the dusty corner of a respected university. I ended up achieving a version of that dream. I got a scholarship and was encouraged to enter a master's and PhD program from a professor I greatly admired. I could see a future career in my mind's eye, but something changed. I realized the academic pressure I was putting on myself was masking a deep lack of fulfillment. I was pursuing this degree simply because I was good at it, never stopping to ask myself if I actually enjoyed it.

Thank you.

I concluded I'd simply gotten it wrong. I needed a new dream to work towards a goal. So my goal became being an editor for a magazine and a bookseller. These dreams seemed a lot more reasonable, and soon I was working for three different magazines, running a school publication, and later worked at a bookstore full-time. Even though I had once again achieved my dreams, I was still struggling to feel at peace.

Perhaps what I was missing was a good relationship with more friends, the perfect place to live. Maybe I needed a new dream altogether. Perhaps if I just had everything lined up in life just so, things would be different. There was something much deeper that was off, something that was following me everywhere. It took a long time to admit to myself that I was searching for peace and achievements when instead I needed to love and accept myself as a soul and nothing else. My achievements could only be a temporary Band-Aid over my wounds, and that was just it. I was carrying my hurts and pains and worries everywhere I went, and I had to heal those things first if I was ever going to find a renewed zest for life.

So I moved to a small town, started working at a local school, selling my art at farmers markets, and even started this channel. It wasn't my dream, but I decided that my new dream was to heal and to find that sense of achievement within myself. No degrees, relationships, or impressive resumes needed. Simply trying to be kinder, sitting with myself, growing a feeling that is somewhere between fleeting joy and sadness, a sort of quiet peace and contentment with who I am.

I've now achieved a lot of dreams I never thought I could. I can now enjoy them fully, knowing that they aren't the reason I'm happy. I don't need to make videos to make me happy. I don't even need to be able to run through a field of wildflowers or spend evenings painting to find peace and joy. My legs could stop working and my eyesight could fail me, and that's why there's something much deeper that needs to guide me. My abilities and accomplishments don't make up the core of what makes my light shine. And I hope the same for you, that you can find a source of your inner light that is not rooted in anything physical of this world, not even your physical self. Something far deeper and perhaps harder to understand. But once you're open to it, absolute magic.

I find this light source and what exactly it is to be a bit different for everyone, but you'll know it once you find it. Like a kindred spirit coming into your life, familiar and true, like coming home after many years of looking for happiness in things that are impermanent and unpredictable.
