## [the challenge of finding true friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4wKjawyt5g)

[Music] Thank you [Music]

Surely something else too this afternoon she had noticed that one of the floor tiles in the kitchen was sticking up. Tile edges had always protruded here and there. [Music]


Slowly, very often, but today was different and I enjoyed every moment of it. And even got to listen to an audiobook. I have to admit, the weather has reflected my mood and I'm feeling peaceful, a little tired, and slower than usual. Pretty typical for the colder months, I think. So, I decided to work on a much-anticipated Autumn recipe. I also plan to spend the rest of the day working on some new art projects as I've relocated my artist studio and I'm attempting to reopen my gift shop today. Hopefully, all goes as planned. [Music] Thank you [Music] [Music]

I thought I'd share something in this video, in hopes to spark a conversation. And that is one about seeking quality friendships. Though I'm quite connected in my community and enjoy quiet socializing, I only really have a couple close friends. This has always suited me, though everyone is different. Over the years of navigating human relationships, I felt that some friendships have solid foundations of love and respect, others grow out of less healthy root systems, at least in my experience. I asked what friendship challenges you have faced throughout the years on Instagram, and many of you shared a dislike of relationships that are built upon constant gossip, negativity, bullying, or other practices that bring you down and suck away your energy. It's a good reminder for all of us, especially this Autumn when we find ourselves cozied up at home, to be wary of the words we use around the people we care about. I truly think words have power to shape our perceptions of ourselves in the world. We are what we think and speak, after all. [Music] Thank you [Music]

[Music] Guys, you need to try it, it's so good. If you make poached pears this Autumn, please let me know what your experience was. I think this is the most delicious recipe I've tried in forever. Anyway, I'm sending you so much love and let's go take a walk in the woods. Thank you [Music] [Music]
