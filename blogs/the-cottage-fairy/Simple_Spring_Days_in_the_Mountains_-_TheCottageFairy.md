When I was a child, we lived in a house that stayed quite cold in winter. On frozen nights, we would put our sleeping bags by our wood stove, and my father would read to us. We had purchased two baby goats a few weeks ago, and unfortunately, due to a congenital issue, one of them had passed away. The other goat was very sad and afraid of being alone. So, until we were able to get him some new friends, he would spend the evening with us on our sleeping bag, wrapped in towels. I have a distinct memory of watching the baby goat, ears pricked, listening in on the storytelling as if he could understand completely. It will always be one of my favorite memories from my childhood.

So, when we all sat together, listening to the sound of his voice over the crackling flames, everything felt right and safe. Even now, I like to spend chilly evenings wrapped up in a blanket with a good book next to my furnace, putting away my phone and taking the time to clear my mind of racing thoughts and worries.

My father's favorite books to read were about myths and legends of ancient peoples. One of my favorites was a children's encyclopedia of Greek Mythology. A story came to my mind the other day as I was collecting lilacs. Long ago, there lived a beautiful wood nymph named Syringa. She spent her days running through the meadows and dancing with the wild rabbits and fawns. One day, the spirit Pan saw her and was jealous of her happiness, wanting it for his own. So, he decided to steal her away from the hills and mountains. But Syringa was a faeries child and afraid of Pan's wily ways. So, she turned herself into a lilac shrub and eluded him. Now, every time the lilac blooms, the sweet scent of the nectar is Syringa's loving offering to the insects and animals.

My father was sometimes deployed in the military and gone for a year at a time. Wishing a lovely day or night, full of dreams and stories and other wonderful whimsical thoughts. Sending my love.
