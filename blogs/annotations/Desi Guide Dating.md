Love comes much AFTER the first date, maybe even many years after. Please don’t proclaim your love to someone on the first date, especially if you do not know them. We understand that you may have feelings, or chemistry towards your date, but that is certainly not love.

Please don’t think that a co- ed dinner qualifies as a date. A date is when two people have some sort of romantic interest or chemistry between them.

The thought of physically putting in the effort to meet someone (or many) and to actually talk to them, when it probably won’t work out anyway, can be an intimidating task. But taking the leap towards open- mindedness is the first step to a successful dating life.

While being direct would be ideal, dating is a game, and to be successful at it, you must play it. The above is better than saying, ‘I really like you, let’s go on a date at a coffee place close by.’ DO NOT do that. Use some of your feminine charms, be subtle.

Prior to your first date, don’t over- text, just do enough to titillate and build interest. A little can go a long way: a flirtatious winky face, a casual ‘see you soon…’. Over- texting before the date is not good, no matter how well you two are virtually getting along.

Don’t reply immediately every time. We don’t want your prospective date thinking you’re just sitting there waiting for their text, even if this is the truth. Play a little hard to get, especially in the beginning. Let them think you have other things going on, even if you don’t.
