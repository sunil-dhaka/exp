Saliva protects the oral cavity not only from too much pain, but also from too many bad bacteria. That’s the job of mucins, for example. Mucins are proteins that form the main constituent of mucus.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Gateway to the Gut >  Page 28
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The fact that we produce so little saliva at night explains why many people have bad breath or a sore throat in the morning. Eight hours of scarce salivation means one thing for the microbes in our mouth— party time! Brazen bacteria are no longer kept in check, and the mucus membranes in our mouth and throat miss their sprinkler system.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Gateway to the Gut >  Page 29
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Munching on our first piece of toast or performing our morning dental hygiene duties adds extra stimulation for salivation, and this washes away the nocturnal microbes or transports them down into our stomach, where our gastric juices finish them off.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - The Gateway to the Gut >  Page 29

If none of this helps, there is another place where the causes of bad breath can lurk— but more of that later, after we have found out about the second secret place in our mouth.

Sometimes, too much foreign material can get caught in the crypts, leading to frequent infections. This is a side effect, so to speak, of having overinquisitive tonsils. So, if the tongue and teeth have been excluded as a cause of a patient’s bad breath, the next place to check is the tonsils— if they are still there.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">

Almost half of us have experienced constipation when traveling. Particularly in the first few days of a trip, it is often difficult to go properly. This can be due to a variety of reasons, but in most cases it boils down to the simple fact that the gut is a creature of habit. The nerves of the gut remember what kind of food we prefer and at what time we prefer to eat it. They know how much we move around and how much water we drink. They know whether it is day or night and what time we usually go to the toilet. If everything goes according to plan, they complete their tasks without complaint and activate our gut muscles to help us digest.
