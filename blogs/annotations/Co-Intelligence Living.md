<div class="noteHeading">

while these uses of AI are still important today, they were not something most people directly saw or noticed in their daily lives.

Similarly, there is a tremendous amount of amateur romance novels included in training data, as the internet is full of amateur novelists.

As a result, it is also likely that most AI training data contains copyrighted information, like books used without permission, whether by accident or on purpose. The legal implications of this are still unclear. Since the data is used to create weights, and not directly copied into the AI systems, some experts consider it to be outside standard copyright law.

<div class="noteHeading">

In the meantime, AI companies are searching for more data to use for training (one estimate suggests that high- quality data, like online books and academic articles, will be exhausted by 2026), and continue to use lower- quality data as well.

A lot of research is going into considering how to design AI systems aligned with human values and goals, or at least that do not actively harm them.

I also believe that this focus on apocalyptic events robs most of us of agency and responsibility. If we think that way, AI becomes a thing a handful of companies either builds or doesn’t build, and no one outside of a few dozen Silicon Valley executives and top government officials really has any say over what happens next.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 2: Aligning the Alien >  Page 35

<div class="noteText">
The result gives AIs a skewed picture of the world, as its training data is far from representing the diversity of the population of the internet, let alone the planet.

Humans are subject to all sorts of biases that impact our decision- making. But many of these biases come from our being stuck in our own minds. Now we have another (strange, artificial) co- intelligence we can turn to for help. AI can assist us as a thinking companion to improve our own decision- making, helping us reflect on our own choices (rather than simply relying on the AI to make choices for us). We are in a world where human decision- making skills can be easily augmented in a new way.
