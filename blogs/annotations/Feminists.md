What struck me– with her and with many other female American friends I have– is how invested they are in being ‘liked’. How they have been raised to believe that their being likeable is very important and that this ‘likeable’ trait is a specific thing. And that specific thing does not include showing anger or being aggressive or disagreeing too loudly.

But by far the worst thing we do to males– by making them feel they have to be hard– is that we leave them with very fragile egos. The harder a man feels compelled to be, the weaker his ego is.

But the reality is more difficult, more complex. We are all social beings. We internalize ideas from our socialization.

Cooking, by the way, is a useful and practical life skill for a boy to have. I’ve never thought it made much sense to leave such a crucial thing– the ability to nourish oneself– in the hands of others.

The sad truth of the matter is that when it comes to appearance, we start off with men as the standard, as the norm. Many of us think that the less feminine a woman appears, the more likely she is to be taken seriously. A man going to a business meeting doesn’t wonder about being taken seriously based on what he is wearing– but a woman does.

Both men and women are resistant to talk about gender, or are quick to dismiss the problems of gender. Because thinking of changing the status quo is always uncomfortable.

‘Why does it have to be you as a woman? Why not you as a human being?’ This type of question is a way of silencing a person’s specific experiences.

<div class="noteText">
Some people will say, ‘Oh, but women have the real power: bottom power.’ (This is a Nigerian expression for a woman who uses her sexuality to get things from men.) But bottom power is not power at all, because the woman with bottom power is actually not powerful; she just has a good route to tap another person’s power.

Culture does not make people. People make culture. If it is true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we can and must make it our culture.
